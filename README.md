# portfolio

The  project  is about my personal portfolio and it is a living breathing  CV  that everyone can see. Having a portfolio website gives you the opportunity to showcases your best work. A portfolio is a compilation of academic and professional materials that exemplifies your skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences.a portfolio website can be used when applying for jobs or internships. The idea is that in just one centralised space, you can quickly communicate who you are, what you do and how people can contact you.
